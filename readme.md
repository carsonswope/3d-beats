Using random decision forests to identify hand pixels!

# Data generation:
Inside the `datagen` folder, there is a `.blend` (blender) scene set up. It contains a python script that can be run to generate a bunch of fake data.
The original hand model is downloaded from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW5dJVQe83U

# TODO:
- train a whole forest.
- train N trees, keep M best of them
- train w/out table, looking for different parts of hand!
